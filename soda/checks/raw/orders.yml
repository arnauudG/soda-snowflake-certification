# RAW Layer - Orders Table Quality Checks
# Database: SODA_CERTIFICATION, Schema: RAW
# Table: ORDERS (20,000+ records)
# Purpose: Initial data quality assessment with relaxed thresholds

# Dataset discovery configuration for Soda Cloud
discover datasets:
  datasets:
    - include ORDERS

# Column profiling configuration for Soda Cloud
profile columns:
  columns:
    - ORDERS.%
    - exclude ORDERS.CREATED_AT
    - exclude ORDERS.UPDATED_AT

# Sample datasets configuration for Soda Cloud
