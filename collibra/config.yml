# Collibra Metadata Synchronization Configuration
# 
# This file contains the database and schema asset IDs for metadata synchronization.
# The system will automatically resolve schema asset IDs to schema connection IDs.
# Update these values with your actual Collibra asset IDs.

# Database Asset ID in Collibra
# This is the UUID of the Database asset that contains your schemas
database_id: "0199e6fb-06b2-7bc1-9c5c-de9744076851"

# Optional: Database Connection ID
# If provided, this will be used directly instead of resolving from database asset
# If not provided, the system will attempt to resolve it from the database asset
# database_connection_id: "your-database-connection-uuid-here"

# Schema Asset IDs by Layer
# Each layer can have one or more schema asset IDs
# These will be automatically resolved to schema connection IDs
# If a layer has multiple schemas, list all their asset IDs

# RAW Layer Schema Asset ID(s)
