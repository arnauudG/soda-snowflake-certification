# RAW Layer - Orders Table Quality Checks
# Database: SODA_CERTIFICATION, Schema: RAW
# Table: orders (20,000+ records)
# Purpose: Initial data quality assessment with relaxed thresholds

checks for orders:
  # Row count checks
  - row_count between 15000 and 25000:
      name: "Order count within expected range"
  
  # Completeness checks (relaxed for raw data)
  - missing_count(order_id) = 0:
      name: "No missing order IDs"
  
  - missing_count(customer_id) < 500:
      name: "Minimal missing customer IDs"
  
  - missing_count(total_amount) < 1000:
      name: "Total amount completeness check"
  
  # Uniqueness checks
  - duplicate_count(order_id) = 0:
      name: "Order IDs are unique"
  
  # Validity checks (allowing some negative amounts in raw)
  - min(total_amount) > 0:
      name: "All total amounts are positive (raw tolerance handled in staging)"
  
  - invalid_count(order_status) < 200:
      name: "Invalid order statuses"
      valid values: ['pending', 'processing', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled', 'returned']
  
  # Freshness checks
  # Freshness omitted (created_at is numeric in RAW)
  
  # Schema checks
